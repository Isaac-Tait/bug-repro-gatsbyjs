Minimal reproduction for GatsbyJS issue 27644

https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/27644

Got tired of adding dependencies in chunks so I copy and pasted from my repo.

npm install gatsby-image gatsby-plugin-feed gatsby-plugin-manifest gatsby-plugin-react-helmet gatsby-plugin-remove-serviceworker gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-plugin-typography gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files gatsby-remark-images gatsby-remark-prismjs gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe gatsby-remark-smartypants gatsby-source-filesystem gatsby-transformer-remark gatsby-transformer-sharp react-helmet react-pro-sidebar react-typography typography typography-theme-wordpress-2016

Of course after I did all the work the error went away on my initial project and I could never get the error to reproduce here either :(
